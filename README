This is a fork/rewrite of the CTK tutorials (git@github.com:saschazelzer/CTKPluginTutorials.git). 
I has evolved during my own attempt to learn the basics of CTK, and is not intended as a general tutorial.

However, it can serve as a starting point while the CTK basic tutorials are incomplete. Start with the commontk.org wiki,
then move here when you find that stuff are missing.

It depends on github.com/commontk/CTK

Use Cases being tested in this project:

* Install and connect to a service in a vanilla CTK plugin
	- Plugin: org.commontk.plugingenerator.core
	- Service: ctkPluginGeneratorCodeModel
	- App: UseCTKPlugin
* Install a CTK plugin (org.mydomain.testplugin)
* Connect to a service (service: TestService in plugin: org.mydomain.testplugin)
* Define an interface in a library, then implement the interface in a plugin, then use it in an app.
	- Plugin: org.mydomain.testplugin
	- Lib: Backend
	- Service: BackendInterface
	- Service implementation: BackendInterfaceImpl
	- App: UseCTKPlugin
* Define a second implementation of the same service in a second plugin, then use both services in the app. 
The second plugin does not link to the app at compile-time.
	- Second Plugin: org.mydomain.backend.impl
	- Service: BackendInterface
	- Service implementation: BackendInterfaceImpl2
